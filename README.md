## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Project Environment Setup

For the Enterprise Console specific development workstation provisioning guide (PHP 8.3, Laravel 12, Node/Vite, QA tooling) see: [docs/environment-setup.md](docs/environment-setup.md). A PowerShell bootstrap script is available in `scripts/bootstrap-dev-environment.ps1` and a DOCX version can be generated with `python scripts/env_setup_md_to_docx.py` (requires `python-docx`).

### Quick Commands

Common tasks are available via Makefile (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell script (Windows).

Makefile examples:

```
make install      # composer install + npm install
make dev          # concurrent dev (serve, queue, logs, vite)
make qa-full      # pint + phpstan + tests
make docs         # regenerate DOCX docs
```

PowerShell (Windows):

```
./scripts/dev-tasks.ps1 install
./scripts/dev-tasks.ps1 dev
./scripts/dev-tasks.ps1 qa-full
./scripts/dev-tasks.ps1 docs
```

### Temporary Dev Auto-Login

To quickly preview the application UI without the login flow you can enable a development-only automatic login middleware.

1. Add to your local `.env` (never commit this enabled):
	```env
	DEV_AUTO_LOGIN=true
	DEV_AUTO_LOGIN_USER_ID=1   # adjust to an existing user id
	```
2. Clear config & cache (if previously cached):
	```bash
	php artisan optimize:clear
	```
3. Visit any protected route (e.g. /dashboard); you should be auto-authenticated as that user.

Safety:
- Middleware is skipped automatically in `production` environment.
- Disable by removing the vars or setting `DEV_AUTO_LOGIN=false`.
- Use only on local/dev; never push an enabled flag to shared environments.


### DOCX Automation

Workflows regenerate DOCX outputs on markdown changes:

-   `regenerate-env-setup-docx.yml`
-   `regenerate-docx.yml`
-   `regenerate-all-docx.yml` (aggregate)
